# Workout-Tracker

## Description

As a fitness lover, an app that would allow a user to create and track workout plans would be great for adding excercises to the most recent workout plan, adding new exercises to a new workout plan, viewing the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the stats page, and the view the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the stats page.
